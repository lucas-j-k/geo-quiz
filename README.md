This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Compiling Sass  
There is a separate npm script set up to compile Sass, run 'watch-sass' in a separate terminal window to watch the scss folder. This compiles everything into the standard app.css file in the src/ directory.
